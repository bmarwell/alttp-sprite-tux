# alttp-sprite-tux
Tux (the Linux penguin / mascot) as a playable Sprite for the SNES Game: The Legend of Zelda - A Link To The Past.

## progression

The Gimp image file contains sprites for about 30% of Tux. Therefore, it is not playable yet.

I haven't made any art for gloves and/or palette changes yet.
